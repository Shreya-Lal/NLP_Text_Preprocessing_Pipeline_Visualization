## Explanation and Usage
### What is Text Pre-processing?
Text preprocessing is the essential first step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that transforms 
raw text into a clean, standardized format suitable for analysis.
                    
### Why Comprehensive Text Cleaning?
Text cleaning is crucial for preparing raw text for NLP tasks. Different text sources (social media, documents, web content) 
contain various types of noise that need to be addressed before analysis.

### Processing Workflow
1. **Text Cleaning**: Optional step with various sub-operations
2. **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual tokens/words
3. **Stopword Removal**: Filtering out common but unimportant words (e.g., "the", "and")
4. **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" â†’ "run")
5. **Lemmatization**: More sophisticated word normalization, uses dictionary forms (e.g., "better" â†’ "good")
6. **Token ID Generation**: Creating numerical representations

### ðŸ§¹ Complete Text Cleaning Options:
1. **Lowercase Conversion**: Standardizes text to lowercase
2. **Contraction Expansion**: Converts shortened forms to full forms (e.g., "can't" â†’ "cannot")
3. **Accent Removal**: Normalizes special characters (e.g., "cafÃ©" â†’ "cafe")
4. **URL Removal**: Eliminates web addresses
5. **Non-Word/Whitespace Removal**: Removes special characters such as hashtags(#)
6. **Punctuation Removal**: Strips punctuation marks
7. **Digit Removal**: Eliminates numerical values
8. **Whitespace Normalization**: Reduces multiple spaces to single spaces
9. **Repeated Punctuation Handling**: Replaces multiple punctuation with single same punctuation
10. **Twitter Handler and RT tags Removal**: Removes @mentions and retweet tags RT
11. **Remove Emojis**: Removes Removes emoticons, symbols & pictographs, transport & map symbols, flags etc.   
        
### How to Use This Visualization Tool
#### Understanding the Color Coding 
Our app uses a visual system to help you understand each transformation:

ðŸŸ¢ Green text: New content added by the transformation <br>

ðŸ”´ Red strikethrough: Content removed by the transformation <br>

ðŸŸ£ Purple: Stemmed versions of words (reduced to root form) <br>

ðŸ”µ Blue: Lemmatized words (dictionary form) <br>

<<<<<<< HEAD
âš« Black: Unchanged content <br>   

### Best Practices
- Order Matters: Always lowercase first, remove URLs before punctuation

- Context Awareness: Don't remove numbers if they're meaningful (e.g., product codes)

- Performance: Pre-compile regex patterns for repeated use

- Customization: Adapt cleaning steps to your specific text domain

ðŸ“Œ **Remember**: There's no one-size-fits-all solution. The optimal preprocessing steps depend on your specific use case and text domain.
